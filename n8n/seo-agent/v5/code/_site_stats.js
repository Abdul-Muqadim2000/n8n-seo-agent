// ---- site-tracking statistics (2026-10-12, FIX_PLAN G28): an alert must mean "this really changed", not "a number moved by 30%".
// Clicks, impressions and sessions are counts over two periods of the same length, so the honest test is the two-sample Poisson test
// (normal approximation, the same idea as the z-tests the AI Pulse uses in v5/code/_ai_stats.js):
//     z = (cur - prev) / sqrt(cur + prev),  |z| >= 1.96  =  outside 95% sampling noise.
// 28 clicks against 20 is a 40% "fall" that any week could produce by chance (z = -1.18); 1,400 against 1,600 is a 13% fall that is real
// (z = -3.65). A change therefore needs three things: enough volume to measure, statistical significance, and a size worth telling the owner.
// Anything large but not significant is reported as "watch", never as a fall — and Google's update dates are named when one ran in the period.
// 2026-10-13 (G28 follow-up): `tested()` puts the source, the period, the test and the confidence into every alert's own words, and
// `position()` replaces the last fixed threshold in the site tracking — "5 places" on a keyword with 12 impressions is not a drop.
