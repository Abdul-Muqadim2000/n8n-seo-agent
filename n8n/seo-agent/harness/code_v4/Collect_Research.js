// Three inputs the research was missing, all built from data the run already holds (no extra paid call):
//   * KWI.gscSeeds()     - the site's OWN Search Console queries as discovery seeds: a query that gets impressions while no live page
//                          answers it (the D11 page inventory decides through SM.matchPage) and a striking-distance query (position
//                          8-20). Search Console is the only first-party record of what people really type, so it now seeds the paid
//                          pulls instead of only being read afterwards (K6).
//   * KWI.calibrate()    - the traffic estimate checked against the site's own measured clicks and impressions where it already
//                          ranks, labelled `calibrated` or `modelled`. A modelled number is never presented as measured (K2).
//   * KWI.serpClusters() - keywords grouped when their results pages share enough URLs, each cluster named by its head keyword and
//                          carrying the shared URLs, so one page can target the whole group (K7). Discovery compares the top 10 at 3
//                          shared URLs from results pages the run already fetched (the live checks and the competitors' own ranking
//                          URLs); the keyword ladder (B2-4, 2026-10-15) buys one results page per rung candidate and compares the
//                          TOP 7 at a 40% threshold, the convention's own current numbers (B2-6, `top_n` / `min_overlap`).
