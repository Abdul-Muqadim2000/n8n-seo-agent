// Three inputs the research was missing, all built from data the run already holds (no extra paid call):
//   * KWI.gscSeeds()     - the site's OWN Search Console queries as discovery seeds: a query that gets impressions while no live page
//                          answers it (the D11 page inventory decides through SM.matchPage) and a striking-distance query (position
//                          8-20). Search Console is the only first-party record of what people really type, so it now seeds the paid
//                          pulls instead of only being read afterwards (K6).
//   * KWI.calibrate()    - the traffic estimate checked against the site's own measured clicks and impressions where it already
//                          ranks, labelled `calibrated` or `modelled`. A modelled number is never presented as measured (K2).
//   * KWI.serpClusters() - keywords grouped when their results pages share enough URLs, each cluster named by its head keyword and
//                          carrying the shared URLs, so one page can target the whole group (K7). Discovery compares the top 10 at 3
//                          shared URLs from results pages the run already fetched (the live checks and the competitors' own ranking
//                          URLs); the keyword ladder (B2-4, 2026-10-15) buys one results page per rung candidate and compares the
//                          TOP 7 at a 40% threshold, the convention's own current numbers (B2-6, `top_n` / `min_overlap`).
// Every function is pure and takes its thresholds as options, so the harness (S52) can drive it directly.

  // data puts the mean reading ease at 69.7 for food and 49.6 for engineering, and Semrush derives its target from the top-10 pages. So
  // the band is now read off the competitor pages this run already holds (Analyze Competitor Pages), measured exactly as the draft is:
  //   CVG.plainOf(md)         the text as Content QA reads its own draft (meta lines and table rows out, links to their anchor text,
  //                           emphasis marks out, whitespace collapsed) — one normalisation for both sides of the comparison

  //   CVG.readBand(pages)     the median Flesch of the pages with READ_MIN_WORDS+ words, and the band around it (BAND_HARDER points
  //                           harder, BAND_EASIER points easier); fewer than READ_MIN_PAGES such pages is "not enough pages", never a
  //                           band. The band's lower edge is kept inside 20-60: a results page written for specialists does not
  //                           license unreadable copy, and a very plain one does not force a technical page into children's prose.

//                    ZATCA, GOSI, "ministry …", "… authority", Emirates ID, UAE Pass, visa / labour card status …), or a body with a portal /

//                    are on government hosts (.gov / .gov.xx / .gouv.xx / u.ae …);
//   'portal'       — a login / portal / password / status check / renewal / verification / application task: people want the owner's own site;
//   'off topic'    — with topics on file (ctx.topics, R13): under a quarter of the keyword's own words have anything to do with what the
//                    site sells ("character ai", "mofa attestation dubai", "mh enterprises uae");
//   'too broad'    — with topics on file: nothing but generic or place words is left of it ("ai", "google ai", "microsoft ai");
//   'other brand'  — one of its words is the label of a declared competitor (cleartax.com ↔ "cleartax"), of a domain on the results page
//                    (facts.ae ↔ "facts"), or a brand name AI uses for another company (seo_cache ai_brands: name -> domain); with the
//                    keyword's own results page in hand also when one domain whose label is in the keyword holds 3+ of the top 5.
// Bounds, so that legitimate keywords survive:
//   * a public body with a topic word is a topic, not a destination: "zatca e invoicing", "fta vat registration", "mohre wps" are kept — only
//     the body alone (plus country words) or with a portal / status word is refused;
//   * a portal word with a content / buying word is kept ("best erp software with mobile login", "emaratax registration guide"); a plain
//     category noun is not enough ("erp software login" is still a login);
//   * a results-page or AI-named brand with a partner-type word ("sap implementation dubai", "microsoft dynamics 365 partner uae") or a
//     comparison word ("facts erp vs odoo") is kept; a declared competitor is kept only when compared ("cleartax vs zoho"); a results-page
//     label (often a dictionary word) counts only where a product name sits — first, or right before a category word ("facts erp", not
//     "erp facts and figures guide");
//   * a domain label shorter than 4 letters, a word of the keyword being researched (ctx.protect: head term / seeds / services) or a generic
//     word (erp, software, tax …) never counts as a brand; "www", "m", "app" prefixes are dropped before the label is taken.
// Relevance to the website's services is NOT judged here. ctx.relevance (FIX_PLAN G19) is the hook: a function (keyword) -> { ok, reason,
// detail } called last, so the first version of G19 plugs in without touching the callers.
