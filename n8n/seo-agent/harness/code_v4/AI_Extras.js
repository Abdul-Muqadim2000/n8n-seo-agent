// W2-E3 (2026-10-23, docs/ai-visibility-2026-10-23/WAVE2_CONTRACTS.md §2): what the owner's coverage options found, one item per site whose run
// ends in this execution: the fan-out ranking gap (fanout_gap_json), the persona effect on API answers (notes_json.persona), demand with the
// monthly market trend (demand_json; the free proxies were written with the row by AI Vis Rows, this adds the trend when it was read), the
// money they cost (`cost_usd`: every task once by its own id across both attempts, read by the run's ledger settle), the update of the stored
// visibility row, and the results pages read now (seo_cache `serp:`, so every other path reads them for nothing today).
// ---- G6 (2026-10-18, AI_VISIBILITY_SPEC.md §10): the AI question panel at enterprise scale — shared by AI Plan, AI Requests, Prompt Jobs,
// Prompt Rows, Pulse Plan, AI Metrics and the Site Admin (inlined by the build). Pure functions, no node access: the harness runs them.
// The money is here too (AIP.cost, section 8: ONE formula for the engine; app/shared/src/cost.ts mirrors it against one table of golden
// cases). And the rest: the limits, the markets and personas a question carries, the strata the daily sample rotates through,
// the requests of a run in one deterministic order (so a resumed run never pays for the same answer twice), the state of a run that is
// split across executions, and the "same question in other words" rule that keeps a 500-question panel from asking one thing ten times.

// KW-SERP / RV-12 (2026-10-21): ONE Google results-page reading per search and per day, shared by every path that reads it.
//   On 2026-10-21 the research, the ladder and the rank tracker read three different results pages for "ai consultant" on the same day,
// and on 2026-10-17 two runs three minutes apart said "no AI Overview" and "an AI Overview was seen". A client must get one answer, and
// we must pay for it once. The identity of a reading is: the keyword (lower case, spaces collapsed), location_code, language_code, device
// and the UTC day. The row in seo_cache is keyed WITHOUT the day (`serp:<keyword>|<location>|<language>|<device>`) and the day is checked
// on the stored value, so the table holds one row per search (overwritten by the next day's read), not one row per search per day.
//   A path asks for a reading with what it needs: a depth (how many results) and whether the AI Overview's content must be loaded. A
// stored reading is used only when it is from today AND at least that deep AND (when asked) loaded the AI Overview; otherwise the path
// makes its request as before and its reading replaces the stored one. A failed read (HTTP error, a task error inside an HTTP 200, no
// result) is never stored. "No Search Results" (40102) is DataForSEO's final answer: read, and empty, so it is stored.
//   Concurrency: two runs that miss at the same moment both pay once and the later write wins. That is accepted: it costs one extra
// read in a rare race and both runs still read a real page. A cache hit costs nothing: the rebuilt answer carries cost 0 and a task id
// `cache:<id of the paid task>`, so the ledger's count-once-by-task-id rule still counts the money exactly once.

// Coverage and demand at the leaders' level, for the AI Visibility Tracker (inlined by build_monitors.py after AIP, SC and AIE; pure functions,
// the harness runs them):
//  1. FAN-OUT RANKING GAP (`ai_fanout_check` N, default 0 = off): the searches the engines ran before answering, deduplicated, the N most
//     frequent checked on Google's top 10 (one results-page reading per search and day, shared with every other path through SC), joined to
//     the site's Search Console queries; per search: how often, which engines, our rank and page, the page that should rank (page inventory),
//     the domains that do, and whether an answer that ran it cited us. "We rank #1-3 but are not cited" is flagged on its own.
//  2. PERSONA EFFECT (`ai_persona_context`, API answers only): the same questions asked of the ChatGPT API with each buyer role as the
//     asker's context and once without (one shared control), named rate per role against the control, two-proportion tested, pooled over the
//     last 28 days of stored runs. Kept out of every headline: it is labelled "API answers".
//  3. DEMAND AS A RANGE: per question, every proxy we hold with its source and date (AI keyword volume, the AI-answer database's question
//     volume, Search Console impressions of matching question queries, the owner's uploaded AI reports), and the low / high they span; the
//     monthly market trend (LLM Mentions historical / timeseries_new_lost / top_mentioned_brands) when `ai_demand_market` is on. The ChatGPT
//     part of the database is US-English only, and every figure from it says so for any other market.
//  4. THE OWNER'S AI REPORTS (seo_ai_imports, written by the app): Bing Webmaster "AI Performance" and Search Console's AI Mode / AI
//     Overview exports, summarised for the period; a Bing file is the Copilot figure's ground truth.
//  5. The run's bookkeeping: its execution ids, its notes (lost / unanalysed answers, questions asked outside their market) and each
//     question's asked state (last run, last time, times asked in 28 days, the run whose gate refused it).
// Nothing here is called unless its option is on or its data is present; with every option off the run asks and costs exactly what it did.
